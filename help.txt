\nDescription
\nTree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth indented listing of files. Color is supported ala dircolors if the LS_COLORS environment variable is set, output is to a tty, and the -C flag is used. With no arguments, tree lists the files in the current directory. When directory arguments are given, tree lists all the files and/or directories found in the given directories each in turn. Upon completion of listing all files/directories found, tree returns the total number of files and/or directories listed.

\nOptions
\nTree understands the following command line switches:
\n
\n--help
\nOutputs a verbose usage listing.
\n
\n-a
\nAll files are printed. By default tree does not print hidden files (those beginning with a dot '.'). In no event does tree print the file system constructs '.' (current directory) and '..' (previous directory).
\n
\n-d
\n
\nList directories only.
\n
\n-f
\n
\nPrints the full path prefix for each file.
\n
\n-i
\n
\nMakes tree not print the indentation lines, useful when used in conjunction with the -f option.
\n
\n
\n-p
\nPrint the file type and permissions for each file (as per ls -l).
\n
\n-s
\n
\nPrint the size of each file in bytes along with the name.
\n
\n-h
\n
\nPrint the size of each file but in a more human readable way, e.g. appending a size letter for kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), terrabytes (T), petabytes (P) and exabytes (E).
\n
\n-u
\n
\nPrint the username, or UID # if no username is available, of the file.
\n
\n-g
\n
\nPrint the group name, or GID # if no group name is available, of the file.
\n
\n-D
\n
\nPrint the date of the last modification time for the file listed.
\n
\n--inodes
\nPrints the inode number of the file or directory
\n--device
\nPrints the device number to which the file or directory belongs
\n
\n-r
\n
\nSort the output in reverse alphabetic order.
\n
\n-t
\n
\nSort the output by last modification time instead of alphabetically.
\n
\n--dirsfirst
\nList directories before files.

\n
\n-L level
